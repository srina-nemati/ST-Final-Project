# ST-Final-Project
Final project of Software Testing course at Shahid Beheshti University. This is the implementation of 3 scenarios that are testing sites using Selenium.

We considered the following three scenarios for this project:
First scenario:
Enter the Quora website, click the view courses button, and enter the courses section. Now we scroll the page.

Second scenario:
We enter the website of Shahid Beheshti University Faculty of Computer Engineering and select the educational section and educational forms, then select entry of 1400 and download.

Third scenario:
We enter the Banimode site and search for the word "perfume" in the search bar. Then choose the first option from the results. After entering the page for the first perfume, add it to your shopping cart, and finally, by clicking the "view shopping cart" button, you will go to the shopping cart page and can see the selected product there.
